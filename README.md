### Team Members:
Evan Hu, Chuqi (Angel) Jin, Aditya Venkat, Rohit Patil, Rahul Katinni, Quynh Tran

### Introduction

Building upon our previous work from the first two assignments, this project aims to show off the work we've done by creating D3 visualizations. We also deployed Apache Solr, MEMEX Image Space, and MEMEX GeoParser to further explore the dataset and its features.
